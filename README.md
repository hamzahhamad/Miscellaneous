## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.13.0 or higher
- Dart SDK 3.1.0 or higher
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Device or emulator for testing

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecast-app.git
   cd weather-forecast-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate code** (for Hive adapters and JSON serialization)
   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Configuration

The app works with free APIs out of the box. For enhanced features, you can add API keys:

1. Open `lib/services/weather_api_service.dart`
2. Replace placeholder API keys:
   ```dart
   // OpenWeatherMap (optional - for air quality data)
   const apiKey = 'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY';
   
   // Weatherbit (optional - for additional validation)
   const apiKey = 'YOUR_WEATHERBIT_API_KEY';
   ```

## üîß Key Technologies

### Dependencies
- **flutter_riverpod** - State management
- **dio** - HTTP client for API requests
- **hive** - Local database for caching
- **geolocator** - GPS location services

## üåê API Sources

### Primary (Always Free)
- **Open-Meteo**: No API key required, excellent accuracy
- **NOAA/NWS**: US-only, government weather service
- **MET Norway**: Global coverage, especially accurate for Europe

### Secondary (Free Tier)
- **OpenWeatherMap**: 60 calls/min free, air quality data
- **Weatherbit**: 500 calls/day free, good for validation

## üèÜ Weather Data Accuracy

The app implements intelligent forecast blending:

```dart
// Weighted averaging based on source reliability
final blendedTemperature = (
  openMeteoTemp * 1.0 +     // Highest weight
  noaaTemp * 0.95 +         // Very high for US
  metNorwayTemp * 0.9 +     // High for Europe
  openWeatherTemp * 0.8     // Good baseline
) / totalWeight;
```

Confidence calculation considers:
- Agreement between sources
- Historical accuracy
- Data recency
- Geographic relevance

## üé® Design System
